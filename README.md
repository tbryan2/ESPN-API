# ESPN-API

"Youtube video goes here"

## Objective
Pull matchup data from your fantasy football league using the ESPN API, Python, and pandas.


## Details
This is the first code repository related to a series of videos on pulling, manipulating, and plotting fantasy football data. If all you want is the data, the main.py file can be run in the terminal and it will output a csv of the matchup data for your league in the specified year. There's also a Python notebook where the code is broken down into blocks and explained, in detail, in the Youtube video. It's key to understand this first set of code in order to progress with the ESPN API.

### Dependencies
The only dependencies beyond having Python installed are the *requests* library and pandas - both can be installed via pip in the terminal.
